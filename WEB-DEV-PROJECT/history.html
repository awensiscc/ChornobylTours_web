            <h1>History of Chornobyl</h1>
            <h2>1. Chornobyl disaster: what happened?</h2>
            <p>
                The Chernobyl disaster is one of the most devastating events of the 20th century, which occurred on
                April 26, 1986, at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (ChNPP) in Ukraine. As a result of a test at the
                4th reactor, a powerful explosion occurred, which released huge amounts of radioactive materials into
                the atmosphere. This led to catastrophic consequences for both people and the environment. The explosion
                destroyed the reactor itself, and fire and radioactive fallout spread for tens of kilometers around.
                Inexperience of the personnel, errors during testing, and design flaws in the reactor were the main
                causes of the tragedy. The accident led to large-scale contamination with radioactive substances, which
                required immediate emergency measures.
            </p>
            <h2>2. Consequences of the disaster</h2>
            <p>
                The consequences of the Chernobyl disaster were colossal. Radiation spread over vast distances,
                affecting not only the territory of Ukraine, but also other European countries. Surrounding settlements,
                such as Pripyat, were completely evacuated, and the area around Chernobyl itself became an exclusion
                zone. People were forbidden to live within a radius of 30 km from the plant due to the danger of
                radiation contamination. Hundreds of thousands of people, including the so-called liquidators - rescuers
                and military personnel who participated in eliminating the consequences, were exposed to radiation. Many
                of them later fell ill with radiation diseases and died. Life in Pripyat and other nearby cities ceased,
                they became abandoned, and nature began to fill these empty spaces again
            </p>
            <h2>3. Chornobyl today</h2>
            <p>
                Today, Chernobyl remains a symbol of nuclear disaster. Despite the enormous amount of destruction, the
                exclusion zone around Chernobyl still attracts attention. The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is closed,
                and the 4th reactor was covered with a special sarcophagus to reduce the level of radiation. In 2016, a
                new safe sarcophagus was built, which should ensure safety for many more decades. The exclusion zone has
                become a kind of laboratory for studying the effects of radiation on nature. Amazing adaptations of
                flora and fauna have been recorded here. Wild populations of animals such as elk, wild boar and even
                rare bird species develop in this place, despite the presence of radiation. Every year, thousands of
                people visit Chernobyl and Pripyat as tourists to see how nature and time absorb what is left after the
                disaster.

            <h2>4. Lessons of Chornobyl</h2>
            <p>
                Chernobyl changed the world. Following the disaster, safety standards at nuclear power plants were
                revised, and many countries tightened controls over nuclear technology. The introduction of stricter
                safety standards was an important step in preventing future disasters. Chernobyl also became a symbol of
                the potential dangers of nuclear energy, and its lessons influenced energy decisions for decades to
                come. Chernobyl has also become part of the world’s collective consciousness. It reminds us of the
                fragility of human control over natural forces and the importance of caution in using technologies that
                can have devastating consequences.
